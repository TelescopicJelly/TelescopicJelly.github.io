    <br> Plant anatomy and morphology</br>
    <p> Plant anatomy focuses on the internal structure of plant cells and tissues, while plant morphology studies their external form. Plant cells are multicellular eukaryotes with DNA stored in nuclei, and they have unique features such as a cell wall made of cellulose, large vacuoles, and plastids like chloroplasts for photosynthesis. Some plastids store starch (amyloplasts) or lipids (elaioplasts).

        Vascular plants, including ferns and seed plants, have a root system for absorbing water and minerals and a shoot system for photosynthesis and reproduction. Non-vascular plants, such as mosses and liverworts, lack vascular roots, and much of their structure participates in photosynthesis. The root and shoot systems are interdependent, but if one is lost, the other can regenerate it. Some plants, like Saintpaulia, can regrow from a single leaf or even a single cell.
        
        Xylem and phloem transport resources between shoots and roots, and some roots store food, as seen in carrots and sugar beets. Stems provide support and can store water (cacti), food (potatoes), or reproduce vegetatively (strawberries). Leaves are the main sites of photosynthesis, with gymnosperms producing open seeds and angiosperms producing flowers with enclosed seeds. Woody plants, such as oaks, undergo secondary growth, forming wood and bark.
        
        Plant structures exist on a continuum, with roots, stems, and leaves often blending into intermediate forms. Some plants reproduce sexually, some asexually, and others use both methods. Understanding these categories helps in studying plant development and function.</p>
